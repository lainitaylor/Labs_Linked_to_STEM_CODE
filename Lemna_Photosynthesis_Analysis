# Below script analyzes class data of the Lemna and Photosynthesis datasets. Datasets should be pre-loaded and pre-created before using the below code

###### Lemna results

# Plot data to see general trends
plot(Ldf$salt, Ldf$total_t2)

# Know that we are using count data, and that data follow a non-normal distribution, so will use a generalized linear model with a poisson distribution (as is used for count data)
library(lme4)
lemna_mod <- glm(total_t2 ~ salt, data = Ldf, family = poisson)

# Get results
summary(lemna_mod)

# Looks like all treatments differ from each other significantly, let's do a post-hoc test to be sure by getting the estimated marginal means (What are our estimated means of the lemna count for each salt level)
library(emmeans)
lemna_emm <- emmeans(lemna_mod, "salt") # get means
pairs(lemna_emm) # show comparisons of means

# Plot the data with ggplot
library(ggplot2)
lemna_plot <- ggplot(Ldf, aes(x = salt, y = total_t2, fill = salt)) +
              geom_bar(stat = "summary", fun = "mean") +
              ylim(0, 500)
lemna_plot <- lemna_plot + labs(title = "Lemna spp. growth after 2 weeks under varied salt levels", x = "Salt concentration in mg/mL", y = "Final thalli count")
lemna_plot

###### Photosynthesis results

# Plot data
plot(Pdf$time, Pdf$photosynthetic_rate) 
plot(Pdf$tube, Pdf$photosynthetic_rate)

# Conduct a t-test to see whether means differ significantly between the two tubes
t.test(photosynthetic_rate ~ tube, data = Pdf)

# Plot the data with ggplot 
library(ggplot2)
photo_plot <- ggplot(Pdf, aes(x = time, y = photosynthetic_rate, colour = tube))+
            geom_point(stat = "identity") +
            ylim(0.01, 0.2)
photo_plot <- photo_plot + labs(title = "Egeria photosynthetic rate every 5 minutes under normal vs high CO2 levels", x = "time", y = "Rate of Photosynthesis in mL/min")
