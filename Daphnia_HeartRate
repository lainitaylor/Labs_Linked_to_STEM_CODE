# Below code is to process results of Daphnia heartrates at hot vs cold water temperatures

# First, let's build our summary dataset to graph
df <- data.frame(temperature = c("cold", "room"), heartrate = c(20.8, 33.4))

# Change temperature to factor
df$temperature <- as.factor(df$temperature)

# This plot is not so good looking, let's graph with ggplot to get something nicer
library(ggplot2)
plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x = temperature, y = heartrate, fill = temperature)) + geom_col() + labs(x="Water Temperature in Celsius", y = "Heart rate in bpm", title = "Daphnia spp. Heart Rate By Temperature") + theme_bw() + scale_fill_manual(values = c("blue", "red"))
